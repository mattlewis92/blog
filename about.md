Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a location independent software engineer who travels the world while writing code. I've started this blog to talk about the things that I'm most passionate about in my life, so if any of these things interest you then I encourage you to [subscribe](http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/feed.xml) for more updates.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
I'll be focusing on the following things:

#### Open source

Over the last few years I've written [lots](https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar) [of](https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-confirmation-popover) [popular](https://github.com/mattlewis92/karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter) [open](https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-resizable-element) [source](https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-draggable-droppable) [projects](https://github.com/mattlewis92/angularx-flatpickr). During that time I've learned a lot of things about running a popular open source project that I'm keen to share. I'm also interested in ways of making open source more sustainable. 

#### Angular

I've been using Angular for over 7 years now, ever since 1.0. I've bet my whole career on it and now I want to help share as much knowledge about it as I can.

#### Startups

I've worked in startups for the past 10 years and love everything about them. I'll be writing about both the good and bad times.

#### Travel

A year ago I moved out of my apartment, gave away all my stuff and got on a plane to start a new life as a digital nomad. I'll be sharing some of the experiences I had here.
